"""
An over simplified lift controller.

Controlls the lift in morse using a socket connection, and subscribes to:

/lift_sim/[command|call]floor : std_messages/Bool

where floor is [B|G|1|2].

The topics correspond to a user pressing the "call" buton on the outside of the lift on floor, or the "command" button on the inside of the lift to got to "floor". The lift travels in the order requested, and waits 8 seconds before closing the door.
