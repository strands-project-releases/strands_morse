* Swithced to human aware
* Added office-sized influence zones and corrected a couple of edges.
* Added topological map file for g4s.
  This should be added to teh datacentre as follows
  ```
  rosrun topological_utils insert_map.py `rospack find strands_morse`/g4s/mapsg4s_sim.tplg g4s_sim g4s_sim
  rosrun topological_utils migrate.py
  ```
  The second command is needed to update the inserted map to the current format.
  The map currently has no docking station to the charging point is reaching be normal movement (human-aware).

* Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/strands-project/strands_morse
* Added a simple node (scitos_node) that publishes topics and provides services according to the real robot.
  This node runs in parallel to morse and thereby complements it by providing missing topics such as /motor_state.
  As this node should be launched whenever the scitos robot is used in MORSE, I added a launch file called scitos.launch, which now bundles the scitos robot state publisher and the scitos_node. I included this new launch file in all existing simulations (bham,tum,uol). That is, future changes wrt to the robot should be realized within scitos.launch instead of the individual environment launch files.
